# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Description

This project provides a detailed analysis of COVID-19 data for three countries: **Kenya**, **United States**, and **South Africa**. It uses a variety of data analysis techniques to explore trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and a choropleth map to compare the pandemic's progression in each country.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:
- Clean and preprocess the COVID-19 dataset to focus on key metrics.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Create visualizations that help to understand the progression of COVID-19 in the selected countries.
- Generate insights from the data, such as vaccination rates and death rates across countries.
- Present the findings in a well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

## Tools and Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following tools and libraries:
- **Python** - Programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas** - Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** - Used for plotting line graphs and visualizations.
- **Seaborn** - Used for statistical data visualization.
- **Plotly** - Used for creating interactive choropleth maps.
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Used for organizing the analysis and visualizations in a notebook format.

## How to Run/View the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Khalipa-B/covid-19-data-analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd covid-19-data-analysis
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies manually:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter
    ```

    Alternatively, if you're using a virtual environment, activate it first and then run the above command.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser, where you can view and run the analysis.

5. Alternatively, you can also run the notebook directly on platforms like **Google Colab** or **Kaggle**.

## Insights and Reflections

- **COVID-19 Case Progression:** The **United States** experienced the highest total number of cases due to its larger population and early widespread transmission. **South Africa** and **Kenya** had slower growth in total cases compared to the United States, although South Africa's cases surged at certain points.
  
- **Death Rate Trends:** While the **United States** reported the highest number of deaths, **South Africa** had a higher death rate relative to its total cases, possibly due to differences in healthcare infrastructure and testing accuracy.

- **Vaccination Rollout:** The **United States** led the vaccine rollout, with more significant progress compared to **South Africa** and **Kenya**, where vaccine hesitancy and slower distribution were evident in the data.

- **Choropleth Map:** The choropleth map visualized the latest data, highlighting the United States' significant COVID-19 burden, while South Africa and Kenya had relatively lower levels of total cases at the most recent data point.

This project provides a snapshot of COVID-19 trends in three countries and can be expanded further to explore additional countries or analyze more granular data such as testing rates or healthcare infrastructure.
